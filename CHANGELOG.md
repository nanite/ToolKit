## 89.0.0

### Changed

- Updated to 1.21.2/1.21.3
- The `/tk clear` command now supports custom input filters as well as optionally being able to remove bedrock from the world
  - This technically replaces existing functionality where a tag or blockstate would be read from the input but due to poor auto-complete, this is basically an unknown feature so we've changed it to one that's much more clear
  - The new syntax is `/tk clear <size> [filter] [removeBedrock]`

## 87.0.1

### Changed
